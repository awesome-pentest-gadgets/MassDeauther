Very simple and fast script. What does it do? Well, it scans nearby AP's and sends deauth packets to each of them. Go that idea from a friend and just did it with my free time.

Usage: ./mass_deauth.sh

This is the final form of this script, i'm not going to touch it EVER again. If you want to change it, improve it or reupload it, go ahead.
